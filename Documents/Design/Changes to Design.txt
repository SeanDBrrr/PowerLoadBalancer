Requests will be handled in subscribe function. 
A stationId is received. 
A checker notifies the main loop when a request is received and then it is handled in the manageIdleState. 
Id is passed as parameter for stations array.


Discussion:
	- should we pass the ID instead of the all Stations object?
	- how can the PLB know about the director ID?
